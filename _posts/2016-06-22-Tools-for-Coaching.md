## Video image in coaching

The way the visual image is perceived and the way we think

Stern (2008) 13-18 visual representation is different than others

Youth are the editors/producers/consumers of themselves taking their own photos/videos etc and posting it online immediately after or during the workout

Youth will create a visual appearance on social media to get sponsors or just to interact with others

Be aware of what the athletes are doing online, and help them manage an appropriate lifestyle.

talk to your athletes about why SM is important in their lives. Moderate it appropriately.

## Transfer of learning framework for effective practice design

Gib Darden and Sandy Wilson

Transferred learning and how it applies to application of practice

Increase positive transfer of practice activities to the game.

Purpose of practice?

- Why, what's the TRUE practice
- Acquisition / Retention / Transfer
  - practice should be evaluated on how well it transfers positively to the target context

Block vs random practice -- Random transfers to the game better

1. Similarity-Based models - specificity of training; match game situations in practice
2. Principle-Based model - common principles;
3. Dynamic Systems-based model - three factor theory; specificity; expertise

### T.R.A.N.S.F.E.R. Concepts for more effective practice

- Type: What type (near vs far; inter vs intra) Stage of learning (What do you want out of the drill)
- Repetitions: Simulate interference levels during reps
- Arousal/Anxiety: Simulate or reduce of Arousal Conditions; Condition = competition; repetitions, etc
- Natural Movement: Timing and structure of movement elements
- Strategy: Simulate elements and cognitive concepts; decision making speed
- Feedback: create independence; open questions
- Environment: sensation and perception of practice condition
- Reflection: elements to transfer; Purpose of practice and performance learning

## Using Sport to Cultivate Resilience

[Polo DeCano](pdecano@uw.edu)

Resilience:

Robustness: Risk factors for negative outcomes
Trait or Set of Variables: Internal
Outcome & Process (fleeting): Experiences within your life

APT- Adapt. Persevere. Thrive.

Sense of purpose: values and goals
Experiencing positive emotions
health attachments * connections

### APT Reasoning: thinking that it is optimistic and positive

Athlete CAN control effort and execution

Neuroplasticity = win the moment

- Can change the brain by enacting thoughts and behaviors in how we think

### Challenge Model

- when you encounter manageable amounts of stress you can grow resiliency
- Empower athletes to be able to grow through stress. If they are too successful, they are not challenged enough.

Applying resilience to coaches

- check outcome and characteristics
- Because of Neuroplasticity it CAN be taught
