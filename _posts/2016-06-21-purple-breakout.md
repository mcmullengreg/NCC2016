DNA testing for athletic skills?

Game On - Pressure to win at all costs endangers youth sports, and what parents can do about it (Tom Farrey)

Project Play - Led by Tom Farrey

  - Wanted to help athletes reach their full potential

Eight "Plays" for Project Play

1. Ask kids what they want
2. Reintroduce free play
3. Encourage sport sampling
4. revitalize in-town league (get away from travel teams)
5. think small (half-sided games; appropriate for age)
6. Design for development (able to access facilities and play at different times)
7. TRAIN ALL COACHES
8. Emphasize prevention

## What's next? (after project play)

How do we take what we know (e.g. project play) and enact it?

Impact free play has on creativity

- **Strategy 1:** Provide initial and on-going coaches education program. Align it with project play strategies and standards
- **Strategy 2:** Provide physical literacy assessment and activity. If you can't run you can't play ___ etc.
- **Strategy 3:** Sport Parent support
- **Strategy 4:** Evaluate and Improvement: Are coaches getting success; are parents happy; retention
