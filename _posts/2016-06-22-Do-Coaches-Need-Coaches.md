## Servant-leadership in Sport

Kirk Wester

- Athletes should be of interest and the coach should have passion for them outside of the sport
- Persuade and convince rather than coerce
- Build trust through honesty and empathy
- Be there for the tough stuff; be in front when the bullets are flying. Allow the athletes to get the credit too.

Athletes would play for SL Coaches:

- Were more task oriented and less ego
- perceived more choice
- more interest and enjoyment
- more confident in their physical skills, cognitive skills and ability to be resilient
- better trained and instructed
- higher levels of team cohesion
- higher winning percentage

Costs of being Servant Leader; Price to pay

- Takes more time
- Give up Pride (personal) and  Prestige (public)
  - When shit hits the fan, you are in front. Go to the back of the line when awards are passed out
- Risk (stress)
- Energy (physical and emotional)
- Burnout

Most things worthwhile come at a price
