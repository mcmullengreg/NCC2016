- Always strive to get better
- Mastery isn't possible since you should always strive to do better things for your athletes
- Use reflection in everything, be able to reflect on specific situations, but also on the overall day.
- Be intentional with your reflection time
- Be specific to your athletes; ask them to do something exactly, don't leave it up to interpretation when it needs specificity
