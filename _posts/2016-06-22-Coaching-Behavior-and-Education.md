## Multi-Sport Approach to Coaching

Life's too short for just one sport

Physical Literacy; Ability, confidence and desire to be active for life

Multi-sport makes you a better athlete.

28 of 31 1st rounders in 2016 NFL draft are multi-sport

70% of olympic athletes grew up as multi-sport athletes. Almost all of them call it the most important part of their training.

Gary Hall Jr. played other sports because he couldn't concentrate on swimming for the entire time

### Keep them playing

Small sided games keep kids engaged

sport-sampling pathway leads to less burnout, less social isolation, better performance and most importantly more lifelong enjoyment in sport.

### Individual Crossover Skills

- Think about the connections between various sports
  - Avoiding tackle/check by spinning
  - throwing motions

can take mechanical stress out of the way.

Use active rest with kids instead of having people waiting

Hide conditioning; don't run just to run

### Questions to ask when developing MENTOR atmosphere

1. How do you like to be managed? (M)
2. How open are you to constructive criticism? What could you do to improve how you view criticism? (E)
3. What do you really care about? (N)
4. What is your purpose? (T)
5. How do you want to be remembered? (O)
6. What would you have liked to say/have done to do things different? (R)

**Tying in:**

By mentoring your athletes and caring about them you can integrate a much better learning environment and gain better respect.

## What do you mean respond, not react?

[Kat Longshore](katlongshore@gmail.com)

> "Coaches are performers, educators, administrators, leaders, planners, motivators, negotiators, managers and listeners, but also people." -- Gigest, Petipas & Vernacchia, 2004)

Mindfulness demonstrates stress reduction and emotional regulation. Able to connect and be present, less reactive.

- be in the present moment
- focus on right now, intentionally

- Habitual Reacting (Mindlessness) Reaction without awareness, autopilot
  - Stimulus -> reaction without awareness
  - Autopilot, going through motions, unsatisfying
- Mindful Responding
  - Stimulus -> awareness -> acceptance -> choice
  - Leads to meaningful and satisfying interaction with selves and others

## Creating a Coach Education Intervention

[Erica Pasquini](epasquini87@gmail.com)

Some formal/informal education focuses on technical aspects, not the inter-personal relationship aspect

Coaches and adults to better to learn by DOING and by learning from others (based on discussion) (Kolb's experiential learning theory)

Awareness of instruction, corrective feedback and encouragement per groups of individuals (high and low expectancy athletes)

- Awareness of actually being aware of the disparity between the top 1/3 and bottom 1/3

Tie in:

- Coaches know that they need to provide feedback and interact with athletes, but the issue lies within knowing who to provide the instruction to.
- Should provide appropriate feedback to **all** individuals, not just top or high expectancy
- By acknowledging the disparity, a coach can provide a better environment by realizing where they live in practice

## Motivating Athletes Through Use of Autonomy Supportive Coaching

Jody Langdon
[C.H. Wilson](charleswilson@georgiasouthern.edu) - @hal_wilson
Trey Burdette

### What?

- Person in authority acknowledges feelings and perspectives of others
- More intrinsic than extrinsic

### Why?

Athletes who perceive their coaches as autonomy supportive show greater benefits regardless of coaching level or sport. Includes:

- motivation
- performance
- future activities

### How?

- communicate value and provide rationale
  - do everything deliberately, but for a reason
  - link the practice/drill with the overall goal
- acknowledge and accept athlete's expressions of negative affect
  - seek opinions, know the voice is being heard
  - "Coach, I just don't feel practice." - "What don't you like about it?" - Focus on why it's important
- nurture motivation
- rely on informational, non-controlling language
- patience

### Planning practices:

- Identify the skills needed, then identify what you need to do to grow the skills
- Ask your athletes "Why are we doing this?" Guided discovery as to why, increases motivation.
