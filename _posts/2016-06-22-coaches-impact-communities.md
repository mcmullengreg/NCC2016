SO coaching education

- How you train someone and work with intellectually challenged individuals
- ATHLETES: want to be treated like we matter

SO Uses sport to change the community and perception

Prelim race: Get time, put times in computer.
Finals: Ranked by gender, ability

In 100m dash, if 400 athletes, divide by 8 (lanes) that's the # of gold medals.

Celebrate the abilities, not the disabilities.

If athlete loses the joy of sport, you are done.

Active listening from coaches towards athletes.

Doing work **with** the athlete, not **for** them. Historically, programs are __for__ the athlete.

Coaches may misunderstand what motivates athletes who have a disability. How may be different, but why is the same.

Important to know HOW to ask a question. Training doctors how to do vision (not always accurate); hearing tests; etc

## Discouraging Findings

Public:
 - underestimates capabilities
 - segregation are best for those with ID
 - etc.

 47 of 109 cases the SO athlete could have competed for their country in the olympics

Coaching education

1. General orientation
2. second course is sport specific
3. 10 hour practicum before they are certified
4. Required protective behaviors
