## Student-Athletes with Learning Disabilities and/or AD/HD: Impact on Success in Collegiate Sport

Karen Collins, Univ of New Hampshire

- Student may not inform the coach of any disabilities
- If the coach doesn't know, how can they enact change for the athlete themselves?

Multiple intelligences and where it fits within sport

- Bodily kinesthetic (understand by learning)
- Understanding Universal Design Learning
  - See, hear, do

**n=57**

- 43% of athletes alter medication around athletic events
- 67% of coaches knew students altered medication
- 36% registered with Disability services
- 56% qualified and use accommodations within the classroom

Team Meetings/Film sessions/conditioning the most affected areas

Practice/Competition/?? was not a key

Take home message:

- Coaches should be aware
- Implications for working with coaches
- Discrepancy between DSS and S/A
- Impact of medications

## The millenial athlete and mental toughness...are they compatible

[Craig Stewart](cstewart@montana.edu)

Ask your athletes to prioritize these characteristics:

- n=775
  - 10+ years in sport
  - 90+% HS varsity or higher
  - 25% still college athletes
  - 90% played 2 or more sports

- Top 3: (parents tell same story)
  - Good teacher
  - Fair and honest
  - Stressed sportsmanship
- Bottom 3: (don't care about these)
  - Get to next level
  - Played their sport
  - Stressed winning

Described:

- Best coaches as:
  - Cared (about the athlete)
  - Good personality
  - Knew sport
- Worst coach as:
  - Negative/abusive
  - Poor teacher
  - bad personality
  - played favorites

Mental Toughness - behavior:

- uses mental processes to continue to strive for excellence
- ability to cope and handle adversity
- rebound from failure with mental skills

Mental toughness - requires:

- Positive mental environment (caring)
- Shared commitment to clearly articulated prioritized goals
- Effective learning environment
- Competitive training in a positive enviro

CAN have success by caring.

Stop worrying about the millennial LABEL and look at their behaviors. They may not know about failure. Help them deal with adversity. Teach them cause and effect.

Coaches have to teach:

- How to act
- behavior has consequences
- how to compete
  - losing and failure is part of competition; it's okay
