Build character on PURPOSE

Without a focus on creating a moral environment (including a coach's behavior) athletes will not learn how to be moral.

Help kids engage in sports that fit their needs.

Invest in kids and move their lives in a way that will never be the same.

InsideOut Coaching, Joe Ehrmann

Beginning to reflect
- Why do I coach
- Why do I coach the way I do
- what does it feel like to be coached by me
- how do I define success

Include character attributes within the daily practice plan.

How do we teach?

daily plan
skills for refinement
routine
differentiate instruction
